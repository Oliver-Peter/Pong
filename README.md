# Pure JavaScript Pong Game
Based on the Beginner JavaScript Game Project from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeY6lXPrPaA) on YouTube.

# Why I make it?
I want to get more familiar with JavaScript and overall in gamified Web Frontend projects.
So this are my first little steps in Game Dev. Projects.
